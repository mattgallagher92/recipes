Serves 4.

## Ingredients

- 4 tbsp olive oil
- 2 large onions
- 8 celery sticks
- 2 yellow peppers
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp chilli flakes
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 230 g brown basmati rice
- 2 400 g cans chopped tomatoes
- 4 garlic cloves
- 2 400 g cans butter beans
- 4 tsp vegetable bouillon powder
- 2 large handfuls of parsley

## Preparation

- Finely grate the garlic
- Finely chop the onions and celery
- Chop the peppers
- Measure out the spices
- Rinse the rice
- Drain and rinse the butter beans
- Chop the parsley

## Cooking

STEP 1

Heat the oil in a large pan set over a high heat and fry the onion, celery and pepper, stirring occasionally, for 5 mins until starting to soften and colour.

STEP 2

Stir in the spices and rice, then tip in the tomatoes and a can of water. Stir in the garlic, beans and bouillon. Bring to a simmer, then cover and cook for 25 mins until the rice is tender and has absorbed most of the liquid. Keep an eye on the pan towards the end of the cooking time to make sure it doesn’t boil dry – if it starts to catch, add a little more water. Stir in the parsley and serve hot.
