Some tips for when you're experimenting with plant-based food:

- If you fancy a cooked breakfast, try hash browns, plant-based sausages, spinach, mushrooms and baked beans
- You can make a great stir fry with tofu, noodles/rice and your favourite vegetables
- Plant-based sausages go well with mash and gravy or in a pasta dish
- Soya beans are a good source of protein
- Nutritional yeast can be used to simulate a cheesy flavour and provides protein and a variety of micro-nutrients
- Many supermarkets sell plant-based ready meals
- Many restaurants offer plant-based dishes
